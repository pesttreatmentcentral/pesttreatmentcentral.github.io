Crop losses due to weeds, arthropods, and illness, though disputed by some as a legitimate procedure, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) regardless of the accumulation of pest control.</p>
<p>Whether you have rodents or routine pests like ants, roaches, or spiders, we will determine the source of the problem.
