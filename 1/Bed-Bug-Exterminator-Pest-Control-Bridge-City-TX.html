The four major issues encountered with traditional pesticides are toxic residues, pest resistance, secondary pests, and pest renewal. Integrated pest management (IPM) is a technique that avoids pest damage with minimum negative influence on human health, the environment and non-target organisms.</p>
<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic methods to control household insect pests.
