<p>Numerous newer pesticides are derived from plants or naturally happening substances (e.g.-- pest, nicotine and pyrethrum juvenile hormone analogues), however the toxophore or active part may be altered to provide increased biological activity or stability. The majority of scientists concur that this will be possible only if we cultivate crops according to the principle of Integrated Pest Management (IPM).</p>

<p>In contrast, natural food production applies many of the same principles as IPM but limits using pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, as opposed to artificial chemicals. Other claims include reductions in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into numerous crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into several crops to decrease the need for other, less environmentally beneficial, herbicides.</p>
