<p>Organic food production is not pesticide-free and some of the pesticides used in an organic system are as hazardous to human beings and nontarget organisms as some chemical pesticides. Pest control specialists can only do so much to safeguard the food supply," says Dr. Zia Siddiqi, Director of Quality Systems at Orkin The fact is, food business operators need to take an active role in integrated pest management by working carefully with the experts.</p>
<p>There are numerous farming practices that make the environment less beneficial to insect pests. IPM extended the idea of incorporated control to all classes of pests and was expanded to consist of all methods. This chapter discusses various techniques to maintain pest insects at tolerable levels or in other words integrated pest management (IPM). Keep children and family pets away from locations where pesticides have been applied.</p>
<p>National Pesticide Info Center: Provides objective, science-based details about pesticides to allow people to make educated decisions about pesticides usage. Mix pesticides according to identify guidelines. Waage (39) suggests that biopesticides could form the methadone of IPM," assisting agroecosystems to recuperate from the routine of calendar spraying while we are redesigning and nurturing them to a more self-renewing capacity.</p>
<p>IPM programs work to monitor for pests and recognize them precisely, so that proper control choices can be made in combination with action limits. However, the significant pattern has been toward using modern chemistry and molecular biology to replace standard pesticides with less hazardous chemicals or nontoxic biologically based products; however these means are still rehabs.</p>
