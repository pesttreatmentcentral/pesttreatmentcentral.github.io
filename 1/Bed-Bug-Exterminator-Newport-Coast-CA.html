<p>Recent studies record the need for continued decreases in harmful pesticide use and practices. Although the basic elements of IPM are always the same, the specific components of an IPM program differ from one environment or scenario to another. When done prior to spacing the plants, application of predatory mites against thrips in potted plants is more reliable.</p>
<p>The principle has been around since the 1920's when cotton pest management program was developed. Pest control companies know the ideal pesticide to use in any scenario, this conserves a lot of costs. Poisoning by direct exposure to pesticides might take place shortly after a single direct exposure (acute poisoning) or gradually after duplicated exposures over a period of time (chronic poisoning).</p>
<p>At the same time, it is also based upon semiochemicals particularly kairomones and allomones 35 The pests are driven away or prevented far from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are simultaneously attracted (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be killed or gotten rid of 35 (Figure 5 ). Most pesticide problems are brought on by a small number of the pesticides readily available today.</p>
