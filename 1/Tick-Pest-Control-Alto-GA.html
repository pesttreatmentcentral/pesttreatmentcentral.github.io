(12) in recommendation to the concept of incorporating the use of biological and other controls in complementary methods.</p>
<p>Without controls on population development, organisms can rapidly accomplish levels at which damage is triggered thus becoming pests (e.g., locust swarms stripping landscapes bare). For example, a wealthy community likely will have a lot of big, pricey homes, so pest control costs could be higher there because there's more area for a pest control company to cover in among those homes.</p>

By remedying the conditions that cause pest problems and using approved pesticides just when needed, IPM supplies more effective pest control while minimizing pesticide usage. Repair work, customize, and set up guttering on the structure to prevent damage from rot and insects triggered by water issues, and to decrease the humidity of the interior, ambient air.</p>
