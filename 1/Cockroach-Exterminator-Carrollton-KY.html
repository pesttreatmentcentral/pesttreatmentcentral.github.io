An effective IPM program consists of pesticides for prevention and active treatment. Utilizing entomopathogenic germs, fungi, microsporidia, nematodes, or viruses, and fermentation by-products of some microorganisms versus arthropod pests, plant parasitic nematodes, and plant pathogens usually come under microbial control (Mankau 1981, Paulitz and Bélanger 2001, Dong and Zhang 2006, Lacey 2017 ).</p>

<p>Very impressed with the professional approach of Sunlight Pest Control team, my home was badly harmed by termite however they have done very good task and they were really courteous.

<p>Think about alternative approaches (other than pesticides) to make your house and garden unattractive to pests. With IPM, you act to keep pests from ending up being a problem, such as by growing a healthy crop that can stand up to pest attacks, using disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from getting in a building.
