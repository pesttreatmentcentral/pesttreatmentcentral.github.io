Farming tackles the problem with incorporated pest management. The term pest" describes more than one reason for problems consisting of diseases, undesirable insects, termites, nematodes, mollusks and weeds.

<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural enemies and prevent pest perseverance include intercropping (several crops in the same field) to make it more difficult for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which draw in pests away from harvest crops and which can later be treated with choose application of pesticides, and delaying planting times to accompany times where pests have emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>
