<p>With IPM you'll utilize the most selective pesticide that will do the job and be the best for other organisms and for water, air, and soil quality; use pesticides in bait stations instead of sprays; or spot-spray a couple of weeds instead of a whole area. Due to any variety of factors, including those mentioned in the Chemical and Cultural sections, jeopardizing the efficiency of natural opponents frequently allows potential pest organisms to experience practically unregulated population development and allows them to reach pest status.</p>
<p>Insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and other pest control and lawn care items are most efficient when they are applied appropriately. You can opt for natural chemical treatments, with botanic or fermented items used to eradicate pests. A resistant variety may be less chosen by the insect pest, adversely impact its normal development and survival, or the plant might endure the damage without a financial loss in yield or quality.</p>
