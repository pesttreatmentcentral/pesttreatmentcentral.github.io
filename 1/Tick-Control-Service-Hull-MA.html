<p>Dorchester County operates a Mosquito Control Program to secure its citizens from the spread of mosquito-borne diseases by spraying pesticides (insecticides), applying larvicide to low-lying locations, and informing its citizens on minimizing the conditions that foster boosts in the mosquito population. This mix of IGRs can be reliable in preventing re-infestation of pests such as cockroaches. SWPM is vulnerable to attack by wood uninteresting insects which, in a collection environment, might trigger severe damage to structures, office furnishings, artifacts and specimens. Applicators perform more intricate jobs, have the ability to use a larger variety of pesticides, and may specialize in a certain area of pest control.</p>
