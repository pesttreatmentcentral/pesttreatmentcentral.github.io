<p>Arrow Termite & Pest Control offers complimentary termite assessments for new clients and termite control solutions for your house. The habits of the pest can be made use of for its monitoring and control through baits, traps, and mating disturbance techniques (Heinz et al. 1992, Shorey and Gerber 1996, Foster and Harris 1997, Vladés et al. 2005, El-Sayed et al. 2009, Morrison et al. 2016 ). When distributed in the field or placed in traps, baits containing dangerous material will attract and kill the pests.</p>
<p>Their expert exterminators are readily available for 24 hr of emergency services for their important clients. Nevertheless, the high capacity for reproduction of insect pests remains, and a population surge of many types can be expected from a low-density level whenever ideal ecological conditions happen or control slackens.
