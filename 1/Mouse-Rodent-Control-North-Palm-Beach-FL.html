<p>Also, consider how the variety of plants to be grown in the same location might affect ease of pesticide applications and spread of disease. Pest control has to do with non-lethal techniques too, such as keeping the area totally free and tidy of any food particles or other attractants, sealing up entry methods such as cracks in walls or the area in between the bottom of a door and the floor.</p>
<p>A method that includes the use of pest-tolerant and pest-resistant cultivars developed through standard breeding or genetic engineering (Douglas 2018, Kennedy 2008, Nelson et al. 2018 ). These cultivars have physical, morphological, or biochemical characters that decrease the plant's appearance or viability for the pest to feed, develop, or replicate successfully.</p>
