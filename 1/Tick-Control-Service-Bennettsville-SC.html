The term pest" refers to more than one cause of issues including illness, unwanted insects, mites, weeds, nematodes and mollusks. A number of treatment approaches have been utilized, including chemical approaches, such as pesticide applications and toxic gas fumigations; and non-chemical treatments, such as freezing or warming the products, the use of micro-waves, gamma radiation, customized atmospheres, and anoxic fumigation.</p>

But by focusing on non-chemical alternatives initially, you can ensure that your pest management program is successfully removing pests at the least danger to your food safety program, non-target organisms and the environment.</p>
