<p>Whether you have rodents or routine pests like spiders, ants, or roaches, we will determine the source of the issue. The objective is to supply a general understanding of the principles of IPM, together with the concepts for application in all crops. When a crop is under stress it can be less capable of dealing with the tension caused by insects that extract plant sap (e.g. aphids, leafhoppers) and this tension may slightly lower the economic threshold.</p>

Pests can be brought into the food processing facility through the supply chain, in the ingredients or product packaging, and the facility itself will draw in pests through food odours and lighting.</p>
