<p>A comprehensive understanding of general IPM principles and different management alternatives for all possible pest issues is essential as some are preventive and others are alleviative.

These avoidance and control methods consist of biological, mechanical, cultural, physical, genetic, chemical, and regulative approaches.</p>
<p>Local pest control services utilize low-cost chemicals that only drive away termites, triggering them to spread out even more and trigger extensive damage to your property. By correcting the conditions that result in pest issues and using authorized pesticides only when required, IPM supplies more reliable pest control while lowering pesticide usage.

<p>If pesticides are required, they are chosen and applied in such a way that prevents interfering with other IPM practices. Almost every kind of pest poses a threat to the homes they occupy, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards.
