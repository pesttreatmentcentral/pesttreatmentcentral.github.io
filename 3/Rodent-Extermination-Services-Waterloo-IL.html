<p>Socio-psychological elements consisting of reasonable and moral factors to consider were discovered to the drivers in IPM execution in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A study of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka revealed that almost 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or disease occurrence and only 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ).
