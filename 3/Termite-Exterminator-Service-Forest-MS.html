<p>A strategy that involves the use of pest-resistant and pest-tolerant cultivars established through standard breeding or genetic engineering (Douglas 2018, Kennedy 2008, Nelson et al. 2018 ). These cultivars have physical, morphological, or biochemical characters that reduce the plant's attractiveness or suitability for the pest to feed, develop, or replicate effectively.</p>
<p>In contrast, organic food production uses a number of the exact same principles as IPM but restricts the use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, rather than synthetic chemicals. Other claims consist of decreases in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into numerous crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into numerous crops to reduce the requirement for other, less ecologically beneficial, herbicides.</p>
