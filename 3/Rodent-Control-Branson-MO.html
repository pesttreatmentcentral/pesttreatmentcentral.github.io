<p>Illness or pests can be present in a crop without causing financial damage. Precision applications of low toxicity pesticides rather than common baseboard applications or treatment of a whole property also have actually shown to considerably minimize the overall volumes of pesticides used. Insect pests often have natural enemies that are helpful to the landscape.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that motivate natural opponents and dissuade pest perseverance include intercropping (multiple crops in the exact same field) to make it harder for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which bring in pests far from harvest crops and which can later be treated with choose application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to accompany times where pests have actually emerged and died off for the season.</p>
<p>The human action depends upon the value of the damage done, and will vary from tolerance, through deterrence and management, to efforts to totally remove the pest. Recent experiences with insect pest management for cotton in the southeastern United States will be used for essential examples in the conversation. The term Integrated Pest Management (IPM) refers to pest control and prevention programs that depend on numerous simultaneous techniques to acquire the wanted outcome.</p>
<p>A thorough knowledge of basic IPM principles and different management alternatives for all possible pest issues is important as some are preventive and others are curative.
