Friendly customer service from my pest control tech.</p>
<p>The decision of the right reason for pest problem (understanding pest biology) and ecology is essential in controling the environment to the crop's advantage and to the detriment of the pest. Insecticides hazardous to most insects (broad-spectrum) will more negatively affect natural opponents than materials that are narrow-spectrum or selective for particular insect types or life phases.</p>
<p>The human response depends on the importance of the damage done, and will range from tolerance, through deterrence and management, to efforts to completely get rid of the pest. Current experiences with bug pest management for cotton in the southeastern United States will be used for key examples in the discussion. The term Integrated Pest Management (IPM) refers to pest control and avoidance programs that depend on numerous simultaneous approaches to obtain the desired outcome.</p>
