<p>The behavior of the pest can be made use of for its tracking and control through baits, traps, and mating disturbance strategies (Heinz et al. 1992, Shorey and Gerber 1996, Foster and Harris 1997, Vladés et al. 2005, El-Sayed et al. 2009, Morrison et al. 2016 ). When distributed in the field or put in traps, baits consisting of toxic product will attract and kill the pests.</p>
<p>There are two various kinds of pest control services. Cultural controls are practices that decrease pest facility, dispersal, reproduction, and survival.
