Flea control efficacy of fluralaner on treated cats, calculated based on flea counts, was significantly superior to selamectin (Table 1 ). Within one week following the application of fluralaner topical solution to cats, flea counts were significantly reduced by 96.6% (Table 1 ), whereas flea counts on cats administered selamectin were significantly reduced by 79.4% (Table 1 ) in the first week after treatment.">
