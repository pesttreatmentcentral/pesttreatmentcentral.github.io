<p>Kaolin particle movies used in natural farming may control some pests, but can negatively affect natural opponents and cause other pests to proliferate (Markó et al. 2008 ). Organic farming practices might motivate natural opponent populations, but a higher number of natural opponents does not always result in pest suppression (Dara 2014 ). Mechanical pest control practices such as vacuuming or tilling use nonrenewable fuel sources and indirectly have an unfavorable influence on the environment.</p>
