<p>Biological control has been successfully utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To resolve invasive pest problems, classical biological control approach is typically used where natural enemies from the native area of the invasive pest are imported, multiplied, and launched in the brand-new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control technique that has been efficiently utilized against a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>Other approaches consist of hand selecting of pests, sticky boards or tapes for control of flying insects in greenhouses and numerous trapping methods.
