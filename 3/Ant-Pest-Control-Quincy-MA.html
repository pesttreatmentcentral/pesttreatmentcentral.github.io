Many anti-pesticide NGOs have a much more simplified meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being almost solely about lowering pesticide use. If all other incorporated pest management strategies are unable to keep an insect pest population below a financial limit, then usage of an insecticide to control the pest and prevent financial loss is warranted.</p>
<p>If, after following planned and preventive management practices (# 1, 2, 3, and 4), pests are above limit levels and beneficials populations are low, release beneficials or use picked biopesticides with low environmental effect. Professional exterminators use different types of baits and pesticides to eliminate and get rid of pests. Reliable, permanent corrective actions can then be required to prevent pests from getting in the structure and infesting the structure and collections.</p>
