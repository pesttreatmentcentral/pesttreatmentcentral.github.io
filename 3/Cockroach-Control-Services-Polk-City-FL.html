<p>Some also acknowledged that if regionally collaborated IPM could happen, even annual management of a constant pest might be made more efficient (Faust and Chandler, 1998). We hire exterminators who focus on commercial or industrial pest control. Constant training and education of farmers represent the foundation for establishment of efficient and strong IPM program in agroecosystems.</p>
