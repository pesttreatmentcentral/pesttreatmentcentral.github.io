Instead, the pest control technician must concentrate on the food handling and vending locations, using bait applications rather than spraying. They incorporate cultural, biological, mechanical, physical and chemical practices to handle pests. Utilizing physical traps to control pests is possibly the most recognisable pest control steps.</p>
<p>Neighborhood IPM specialists work to identify and correct pest-friendly conditions, getting rid of access to food, water and harborage by improving sanitation, upkeep, exclusion and landscape management practices.
