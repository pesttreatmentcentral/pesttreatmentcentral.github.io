<p>All at once, it is also based upon semiochemicals particularly allomones and kairomones 35 The pests are pushed back or hindered far from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are all at once drawn in (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be killed or removed 35 (Figure 5 ).
