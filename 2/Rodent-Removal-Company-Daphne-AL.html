It is a term that describes the way in which growers cultivate and protect their crops based on an understanding of cycles in and around plants, of balances and relationships of dependence between plants, micro-organisms, nutrients and insects.</p>
<p>Todays specialists use Integrated Pest Management methods that include traps and exemption techniques to control pests. 2Standard Covered Pests include cockroaches, mice, rats, silverfish, "house" ants (excluding carpenter ants, fire ants, pharaoh ants & tawny insane ants), clothes moths, non-poisonous spiders, scorpions, centipedes, millipedes, earwigs, home crickets and paper wasps.</p>
<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control household insect pests. Many anti-pesticide NGOs have a far more simple definition of IPM - they see IPM as being nearly solely about lowering pesticide use.
