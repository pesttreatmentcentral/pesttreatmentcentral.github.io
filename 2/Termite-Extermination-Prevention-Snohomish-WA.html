<p>In referral to the principle of integrating using other and biological controls in complementary methods, the term was later widened to accept collaborated use of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural opponents are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have actually been chosen either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to possess greater levels of resistance.</p>
<p>Augmentation through propagation and release of natural enemies is a location of biological control that has actually gotten much attention in recent years. This element deals with the management element of the new IPM design for information collection, organization, and real actions versus pest infestations.
