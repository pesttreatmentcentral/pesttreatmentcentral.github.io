<p>The habits of the pest can be exploited for its tracking and control through baits, traps, and mating disruption strategies (Heinz et al. 1992, Shorey and Gerber 1996, Foster and Harris 1997, Vladés et al. 2005, El-Sayed et al. 2009, Morrison et al. 2016 ). When distributed in the field or positioned in traps, baits including toxic product will draw in and kill the pests.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural enemies and dissuade pest perseverance consist of intercropping (several crops in the same field) to make it harder for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which attract pests away from harvest crops and which can later on be treated with select application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to accompany times where pests have emerged and died off for the season.</p>
<p>This information, in mix with available pest control techniques, is used to manage pest damage by the most economical ways, and with the least possible risk to people, property, and the environment. Applications of pesticides are constantly the last option in an IPM program. This is gone over in Chapter 16.
