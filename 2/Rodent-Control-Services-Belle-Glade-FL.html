<p><img src="https://pestimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/pest-treatment.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Dorchester County operates a Mosquito Control Program to secure its people from the spread of mosquito-borne diseases by spraying pesticides (insecticides), using larvicide to low-lying locations, and informing its citizens on reducing the conditions that promote boosts in the mosquito population. This mix of IGRs can be reliable in avoiding re-infestation of pests such as cockroaches. SWPM is susceptible to attack by wood dull insects which, in a collection environment, may trigger serious damage to structures, office furnishings, artifacts and specimens. Applicators perform more complicated tasks, are able to use a larger range of pesticides, and may focus on a particular location of pest control.</p>
