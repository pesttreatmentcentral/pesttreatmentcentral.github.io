<p>Management of trap and nursery crops and surrounding environment is also included to divert insect attack far from the crop. Managing pests can be carried out in lots of ways but an effective way is to clear out the bugs regularly.

<p>Without controls on population development, organisms can rapidly achieve levels at which damage is caused hence becoming pests (e.g., locust swarms stripping landscapes bare). For instance, a wealthy community likely will have a great deal of large, pricey houses, so pest control expenses could be greater there because there's more territory for a pest control company to cover in among those houses.</p>
