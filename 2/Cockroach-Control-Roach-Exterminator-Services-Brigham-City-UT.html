A survey of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka showed that nearly 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or disease incident and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A survey carried out by Parsa et al. (2014) also showed that a lack of qualified IPM professionals and extension teachers was an impediment for IPM execution in industrialized countries.</p>
