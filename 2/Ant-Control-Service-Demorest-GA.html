Some need long-term agreements that cost $400 or more even though for the majority of pests, a single treatment done well need to suffice. As soon as the committee comprehends the kinds of pests that may go into the building and potentially damage collection materials, the next action is to set up an IPPM program to deal with the recognized requirements.</p>

Modern crop varieties often unintentionally develop conditions which prefer pest species (e.g., pest types which have bored deeper into larger fruit making them inaccessible to natural opponents).
