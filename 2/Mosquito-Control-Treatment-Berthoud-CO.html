<h3>The Do's and Don'ts of Pest Control Berthoud CO</h3>
<p>Biological pest control steps benefit from the hierarchy within nature. IPM programmes initial task is to develop appropriate pest levels, called action thresholds, and apply controls where the thresholds are crossed. Knowledge of these thresholds and characteristics of pests and natural enemies helps to prevent unnecessary (chemical) interventions. Some termite control service technicians even fix structural damage triggered by termites.</p>
<p>When kept for a long time, stored item pests are most likely to be in a food ingredient on delivery to a processing factory or a processed food product. Applying pesticides to crops, animals, buildings or landscapes on a regular basis, despite need, is not IPM. The reliance on pesticides as a sole method of control has led to the development of insect resistance and negative impacts on human health, natural opponents, and the environment.</p>
